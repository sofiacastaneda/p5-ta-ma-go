## [た·ま·ご / ta·ma·go]

The word `"tamago"` means egg in japanese. However, if you break down each of its syllables, you can get new and interesting words from every one of them. These words are used to organize and provide a way of navigating thorugh my catalog of p5.js skectches, made by me.

So, which are the words?

### たま
>`ta·ma : ball; sphere; globe; orb.`

Everything here has something to do with circles: its shape, boundaries, curve; as well as repetition or loops (circling back) - end connected to beginning.


### ま
`ma : time; pause; space.`

Everything here has something to do with temporality, transience or the dimensions of height, depth, and width within which all things exist and move.


### ご
`go : language; word.`

Everything here has something to do with speech, its written representation through characters, letters, symbols, poetry and/or communication.
